image_prompt = """You are a highly meticulous AI assistant that extracts and summarizes every possible piece of visual information from an image without omitting any detail.  
    Your task is to generate an exhaustive, structured summary of the image that captures all the text, visual elements, layout, colors (if relevant), numbers, figures, and any context or formatting that might be useful.  
    Do not generalize or paraphrase — capture the content exactly as it appears. Use bullet points, lists, or structured sections (e.g., titles, tables, headers, footnotes) to organize your summary.  

    Be especially attentive to:
    - All visible text, including headers, footnotes, and marginal notes  
    - Tables: Capture each row and column verbatim including headers and cell values  
    - Graphs/Charts: Explain all axes, labels, legends, data points, patterns, and conclusions  
    - Visual layout and structure: Describe how content is arranged (e.g., two-column layout, centered title, left-aligned figure)  
    - Icons, logos, or images embedded within the image: Describe them accurately  
    - Fonts, colors, and emphasis (e.g., bold, italic, underlined) if they seem meaningful  
    - Dates, numbers, symbols, or special formatting exactly as shown  
    - If the image is a document or scanned page, preserve hierarchy and document structure  

    Output the result in structured markdown with clear section headers (e.g., "Header", "Table 1", "Figure Description", "Text Body", "Footnotes").  
    Your goal is to allow someone to fully understand the image without seeing it, preserving maximum detail for use in downstream AI models or search systems."""


rfi_painpoint_prompt = """
You are a highly capable business analyst AI with deep expertise in sales, technology, and market research. Your task is to analyze a document and determine whether it is a Request for Information (RFI) or is related to a sales proposal for digital or technology solutions.

If the document **is not** an RFI or **not** related to a sales or technology solution proposal, respond with:
null

If the document **is** relevant, extract and synthesize **three key insights or business pain points** that the client organization is implicitly or explicitly concerned about. Each pain point should be labeled under a relevant category, followed by a brief, insightful summary.

Here is the document context:
{context}

Respond with **only** a valid JSON dictionary using the following format:

{{
    "Category 1": "Insightful and concise pain point summary.",
    "Category 2": "Another brief and relevant pain point summary.",
    "Category 3": "A third valuable insight from the RFI."
}}

❌ Do **not** add any explanation, text before or after the dictionary, markdown, comments, or labels.  
✅ Return **only** the raw JSON dictionary or null — nothing else.

!!!IMPORTANT 

if the given document (context ) is not related to the Sales proposal then return NULL i.e empty json : Keep this in mind

service_extractor_template= '''You are a B2B sales proposal assistant. Based on the following inputs:

- **Client Data**: {{client_data}}  
- **Seller Data**: {{seller_data}}  
- **Seller RFI Document Context**: {{seller_doc}}

Your task is to return a JSON-style Python dictionary with exactly **6 services** the seller should propose to the client.

## Rules:
- Focus strictly on **client needs**, challenges, and expected business value.
- Services should directly align with pain points like revenue, cost, expansion, compliance, etc.
- Do **not** return more or less than 6 services.
- Format each service as:
  
```python
{{
    "Service Title 1": "A detailed description of how this service helps the client's specific needs and business challenges.",
    "Service Title 2": "Explanation...",
    ...
    "Service Title 6": "Explanation..."
}}
```

## Example structure (output format to follow):
```python
{{
    "Revenue Intelligence Platform": "Helps address the client's 15% YoY sales decline by providing real-time insights into pipeline health, win rates, and sales team performance.",
    "Dynamic Pricing Engine": "Tackles shrinking deal sizes and price competition by using AI to recommend optimal pricing strategies based on market data and buyer behavior.",
    "Cost Optimization Analytics": "Enables visibility into rising COGS and labor costs by identifying waste, inefficiencies, and renegotiation opportunities across vendors.",
    "Go-to-Market Expansion Suite": "Supports underperforming geographic expansion by offering market entry playbooks, TAM sizing tools, and localized campaign assets.",
    "Legacy Modernization Stack": "Addresses the client's outdated IT systems and integration issues through a suite of modern, cloud-native and secure APIs.",
    "Compliance Automation Service": "Mitigates audit and privacy risks by automating compliance workflows and integrating regulatory updates into daily ops."
}}

Only return the final dictionary — no explanations or prefaces.
