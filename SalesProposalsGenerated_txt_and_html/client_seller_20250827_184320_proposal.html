        <h3 class="section-title">Understanding Your Challenges</h3>
        <div class="section-content"><p>Growth Sutra faces significant headwinds in revenue generation and cost management. Declining sales, missed revenue targets, and a shrinking average deal size point to inefficiencies in sales processes and increasing competitive pressures. The rise in customer churn and declining revenue per customer further exacerbate these issues. Simultaneously, increased costs of goods sold, rising labor costs, and escalating raw material prices are squeezing profit margins. These challenges are compounded by outdated processes and increasing technology infrastructure expenses that aren't translating into proportional business benefits. Crunchbase understands the urgency of these issues and the need for a strategic, data-backed solution to drive both top-line growth and bottom-line efficiency.</p></div>
