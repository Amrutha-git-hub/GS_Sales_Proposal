        <h3 class="section-title">Understanding Your Challenges</h3>
        <div class="section-content"><p>We recognize that lichess.org is currently facing significant headwinds in terms of revenue and cost management. The decline in sales, despite overall market growth, indicates potential issues with market positioning, competitive pressures, or sales effectiveness. The missed quarterly revenue targets and decreased average deal size further underscore the need for a comprehensive revenue growth strategy.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the increased customer churn rate suggests a need to improve customer retention and loyalty. The drop in revenue per customer, coupled with the underperformance of new product launches, highlights opportunities to optimize pricing strategies and product development processes. Seasonal revenue fluctuations add another layer of complexity to revenue forecasting and resource allocation.</p>
<p>On the cost side, the rise in the cost of goods sold, labor costs, and raw material prices is putting pressure on margins. Decreased operational efficiency and increased procurement costs further exacerbate the situation. The growing technology infrastructure and regulatory compliance expenses demand a closer look at cost optimization strategies. We understand these challenges and are prepared to develop targeted solutions to address each of them effectively.</p></div>
